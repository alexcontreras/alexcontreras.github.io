# Dynamic Landing Page
Inspired in the Chrome Extension called _Momentum_ (download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en)) this little project will show a background and a greeting depending on the time of the day.

It will also store your name and a single ToDo in the browser local storage
